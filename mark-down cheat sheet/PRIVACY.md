# Privacy Policy

The _Markdown Here_ browser extension strictly does one thing: Allows users to convert Markdown to HTML inside a rich edit control. Not one thing else.

This means that:
- It collects no user or usage data.
- It does not read or modify any part of any site besides the contents of the focused edit control, and only when the user tells it to do so.
- It makes no external requests at all. All rendering is done locally.

## Optional third-party: LaTeX image rendering service

If you choose to use _Markdown Here_'s LaTeX math rendering feature, the contents of your math equations will be sent to a third party to create the image containing your math. (That image is created at the time that the browser displays it, which is usually when the image element is inserted into the page). By default that third-party service is [CodeCodgs](https://www.codecogs.com/pages/agreements/privacy_policy.php) although [other services](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks#tex) may be used.
